## Lessons / Insights Learned
During the development of VisualSonic, there were many unexpected challenges that occurred. A common theme throughout was learning the limitations of the library you're working with and 
how to work within those restrictions to get the result you want. This came when working with integration of audio playback in the browser, here's what I've learned:

1) Plan for the unexpected
   * In working with the p5.js library and React.js, there were certain restrictions that prevented proper loading of audio files. A thorough examination of the problem was necessary in conjunction with thorough 
     researching and debugging. Learning about other similar technologies and comparing their features to the current technology in use was key in getting past roadblocks during development.

2) Be adaptable
   * There were times when choosing one solution made other problems rise to the surface. Managing the project working state and dealing with version control played a big role in handling edge cases or 
     errors. Being able to pivot from one decision to another and learning to be flexible in the development process led me to understand the code much better, which improved my problem-solving skills overall.
   
3) Experimentation
   * Having an open mind and approaching a problem from different perspectives was critical in implementing the final features of the project. This taught me the importance of testing and iterating on existing 
     ideas to achieve a result that wouldn't have been thought of before. Learning the tools of the p5 library and their functions gave me a holistic view of what features to keep versus which features to 
     eliminate altogether.
